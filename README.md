**`Graphics Programmer (Developer/Artist)`**

I'm an indie desktop developer trying to understand the secrets of graphics programming, and most of all, I'm an artist. 
I've been using [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com) since April 2023, and it changed my life, literally. It made me want to 
explore how things are rendered to the screen and how they can create a stunning game put together. 
I'm now developing my own game engine, and hopefully will someday create my dream game...👾

  <summary><h3>✏️ My Art</h3></summary>
  Art is something I believe should require a minimum amount of talent. Unfortunately, most "artists" these days don't even 
  try, they just call the pair of glasses laying on the counter art. That's what it is. So I decided to learn by myself, trying 
  to improve my technique each time, to learn from what I did wrong on the latter. My art consists of drawing real people with 
  the most realism possible, all that with only colored pencils. Now I don't have much pieces to be proud of, but trust me, 
  I'm working on something so big, it sure is going to be my best one ever. Stay tuned.
